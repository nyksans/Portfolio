My First Web Project Portfolio

Having just finished my first web project, I must say the process was not only hard, but also very satisfying. It's an amazing feeling to be able to see your idea that you have only had in your head, come to life for the first time in a web browser. In this case, the site is a nice looking and well functioning portfolio web application which is developed to illustrate my programming path and knowledge, skills completed by me.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: This was used in creating the general layout of the site content.

CSS3: It was used for all typesâ€™ graphics secession and presentation including the flexible box and grid elements or layout for proper responsiveness.

AOS (Animate on Scroll) by Michalsnik: This library was one of the window users were able to overlook regarding construction, or rather integration into the website since it added those appealing smooth animations as the user scrolls the web page which was a hit amongst the users. As they scroll the page, other various elements gradually appear to the view either by bending or zooming in.

Leading up to my project, I followed an excellent tutorial by ProCoder on Youtube which took me through each aspect. The tutorial was very helpful for me in understanding the basics of web development and practicing everything I knew. From building the basic HTML structure to creating animations and interactive elements.
